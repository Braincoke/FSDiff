A tool to find the differences between two snapshots of a file system.

This software is written as part of my Master's Degree in Computing.

The software aims at providing a way to compare two snapshots of a file system to identify created, deleted and modified files.
One application of such a software is to help in the discovery of new forensic artifacts.
